## What is this?

The [LearnHyperapp](https://github.com/LearnHyperapp) organization is dedicated to creating hyperapp tutorials examples, and overall promoting the use of hyperapp.

## Ways Contribute

 1. Quality code examples. Quality means well written, tested, and documented code.
 2. Tutorials to guide users through complex topics. Topics should include tooling (webpack, parcel, etc.), project setup, and application structure.
 3. Translations. Having well maintained and accessible information makes our community stronger.

Please DM me on slack (mrozbarry) to be given access to a repository.
Currently, I am vetting on people on per-repository basis until other guidelines are put into place.

This is a living document that will be actively updated by the community.
